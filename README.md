## NOAA Weather Data Analysis - JFK Airport (New York)
This project is a notebook that analyzes and forecasts weather patterns using the NOAA Weather Dataset from JFK Airport in New York.
The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, from raw data cleaning to advanced time-series forecasting.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into three main parts, mirroring the data science lifecycle:
- Data Cleaning: Prepares the raw data by handling inconsistencies, converting data types, and engineering new features from the existing data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visually and statistically explores the cleaned data to gain insights and understand its characteristics.
- Time-Series Forecasting: Uses the processed data to build and evaluate predictive models for future temperature values.

## How to Use This Project
To run this notebook yourself, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (main_file.ipynb) and run the cells sequentially.
